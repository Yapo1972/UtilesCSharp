our machine.config file already contains certain values such as connection strings, membership provider and role manager setup and your web.config file inherits all settings from there.

The machine.config file on your machine is set up to add a membership provider using a connection string called LocalSqlServer. So when you use the Authorize attribute, it first tries to use that provider instead of Identity. The same goes for the role manager.

You can disable this by clearing the existing providers in your web.config like this:

<configuration>
    ....
    <system.web>
        ...
        <membership>
            <providers>
                <clear/>
            </providers>
        </membership>
------------>>>>>>        <roleManager enabled="false" />
    </system.web>
</configuration>
Additionally you may need to add this to your appSettings:

<appSettings> 
    <add key="enableSimpleMembership" value="false" /> 
</appSettings>
